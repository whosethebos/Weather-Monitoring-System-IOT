# Weather-Monitoring-System-IOT

## Abstract
Weather is the state of the atmosphere, to the degree that it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy. Most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather generally refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, “weather”, is understood to mean the weather of earth. Monitoring the weather conditions manually is difficult. The present work is to develop an automated system which monitors the weather condition. The weather condition is driven by air pressure (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another. These pressure and temperature differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot. Through this system we can automatically collect the information about humidity and temperature. The details are stored in a database and according to current and previous data we can produce the results in graphical manner in the system. The objective of this project is to formulate the weather and be able to forecast the weather without human error and applying the machine learning algorithm for the collected data using backpropagation neural network algorithm which gives highest accuracy rate in which all household and farmers will be benefited.
